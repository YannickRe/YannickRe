# Heya, I'm Yannick Reekmans 🚀
<h3 align="center">Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect | Business Applications & Microsoft 365 Development MVP</h3>

## About me
Yannick ([a Microsoft 365 Development & Business Applications MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003400)) is born and raised in SharePoint, starting out his career in 2011 when SharePoint 2010 was still new and shiny. The changing reality of the cloud made him expand his knowledge to the whole of Office 365 and Azure, but SharePoint and Microsoft Teams are still his focus areas. 

He is a Managing Partner and Cloud Solution Architect at [Qubix](https://www.qubix.be), a Belgium-based consultancy firm, responsible for the technical underpinnings of products and solutions.
He owns [KEOS](https://www.keos.be), a management company to support his independent work.

Problem solving and development are his passion, still working day to day with code. 

He always asks the important questions: How does it work? What do you want to achieve? Do we really need development for this? Where's the coffee?
